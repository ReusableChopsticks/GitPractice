# Making a change from a detached HEAD state by viewing an earlier commit using git checkout <commitID>

# Remember that when you do git revert <commit ID>
# You revert the changes made in commit ID
# so it goes back to what the state was before that commit!
# Also, it is not recommended to git revert a merge from a workflow standpoint
